# node-hono-assistant-ui

A chat agent with a web frontend built on [assistant-ui](https://www.assistant-ui.com),
served with [Hono](https://hono.dev). The browser talks to substructure's native
**AG-UI** endpoint through assistant-ui's
[AG-UI runtime](https://www.assistant-ui.com/docs/runtimes/ag-ui/overview)

`server.ts` does three things: it's the agent worker (the engine calls it), it mints a
short-lived browser token, and it serves the built UI. The browser (`web/`) renders a
pre-built `<Thread>` wired to the engine with `useAgUiRuntime`.

## Run

Install the CLI:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://subs.dev/cli.sh | bash
```

Three things: the engine, the app, the browser.

**1. Start the engine** — it holds the LLM key and drives the loop:

```sh
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
subs serve -c subs.toml
```

**2. Build and start the app**:

```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm start          # http://localhost:4444
```

**3. Open** <http://localhost:4444> and ask *"what time is it in my time zone?"* — the reply
streams in and both tool calls render inline as cards.

## Tools

Two tools, one of each kind:

- **`get_current_time`** runs on the **worker** (server-side) and is declared in the worker.
- **`get_timezone`** runs in the **browser** (client-side) and is declared in the client.

To restrict which client tools are honored, `decide()` can handle `client.messages` and return
its own `agent` config with a filtered `trigger.client.tools` to override the default proposal.

## Regenerate types

`protocol.ts` is generated from `schemas/protocol.schema.json` and committed. To regenerate
after a protocol change:

```sh
npx quicktype --src-lang schema --lang typescript \
    --src ../../schemas/protocol.schema.json \
    --top-level Protocol --just-types --prefer-unions -o protocol.ts
npx @biomejs/biome format --write protocol.ts
```
