# no-code-basic

An agent that is one file. There is no worker and no code.

The engine proposes each step of a turn. This agent has no `worker`, so the
engine accepts its own proposal.

## Run

Install the CLI:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://subs.dev/cli.sh | bash
```

Deploy the file and give it a key:

```sh
subs login
subs apply
subs auth llm.openrouter
```

The agent now runs on the deployment `[remote]` names, on the key you uploaded.
The file never holds a key. It only names one.

```sh
subs run assistant "hi"
```

## Run it here instead

Delete `[remote]` and the turn runs on this machine, on your own key:

```sh
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
subs run -c subs.toml assistant "hi"
```

## Outgrow the file

Add a `worker` URL to the agent, and the engine POSTs every decision to your
code instead. See [node-hono-basic](../node-hono-basic).
