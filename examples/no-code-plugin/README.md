# no-code-plugin

An agent that uses an [agent plugin](https://agent-plugins.org): a directory
holding a skill and an MCP server, declared in one line. There is no worker
and no code — plugin code never runs; the CLI resolves the directory to data.

The plugin bundles an incident-response *method* (`skills/respond/`) with the
file tools to carry it out (`mcp.json`). `mcp-server.mjs` serves the
`runbooks/` directory over `list_dir` and `read_file`, standing in for
wherever your runbooks really live, so the example runs with nothing to sign
up for.

The knowledge sits in two places on purpose. The escalation policy rides
*inside* the plugin (`references/escalation.md`), fixed at apply. The
runbooks sit *behind the server*, read live — edit one and the next incident
reads the new version.

## Run

Install the CLI:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://subs.dev/cli.sh | bash
```

Start the file server and give the engine a key. The server is on this
machine, so the turn runs here too — there is no `[remote]` in this file.

```sh
node mcp-server.mjs &
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
```

```sh
subs run oncall "the database is down, what do I do?"
```

```text
● skill {"name":"runbooks:respond"}
  Skill runbooks:respond — Respond to an on-call incident…
● files__list_dir {}
  database-down.md
● files__read_file {"path":"database-down.md"}
  …
● skill {"name":"runbooks:respond","file":"references/escalation.md"}
  1. Check the connection pool first …
  2. Restart the replica, never the primary: `db-ctl restart replica-1`
  …
  Escalate only if the primary itself is down.
```

## What happens

The agent names the plugin, so the engine fetches its server before the first
model call and announces it once. The system prompt carries the plugin's
catalog entry — the plugin, its skills, and their descriptions — and the
server's tools. The skills themselves stay out until one is asked for.

The incident matches the skill, so the model calls
`skill({name: "runbooks:respond"})` and gets the instructions back. The skill
says to answer from the runbooks, so the model lists them, reads the matching
one, and reads the bundled escalation policy with the same `skill` tool and a
`file` argument.

The model does not turn the plugin on; naming it in the config did that.
`skill` reads a skill and nothing else.

## The plugin's server is a connection

`mcp.json`'s `files` joins the registry as `plugin.runbooks.mcp.files`, and
everything about connections applies to it: filters, approval,
`subs auth plugin.runbooks.mcp.files` when a server needs one. The model sees
its tools under `runbooks_files__<tool>`.
`mcp.json` has no field for how a server authenticates, so the declaration
says it where it knows better:

```toml
[plugin.runbooks]
path = "./plugins/runbooks"
auth = { files = "none" }
```

## Narrow it, like any connection

The knobs on the agent's entry apply to the plugin's servers:

```toml
[agent.oncall]
plugins = [{ id = "runbooks", tools = { include = ["read_file"] } }]
```

`read_only` works too, and reads the server's annotations: both tools here
declare `readOnlyHint`, so both survive it — a server that annotates nothing
would give you none.
