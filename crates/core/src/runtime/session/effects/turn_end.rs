//! The end of a turn.
//!
//! ```text
//! Queued ─dispatch→ (removed) ⇒ emit turn.completed + session.done
//! ```
//!
//! Not work, and not tracked: a turn's end has no record in the effect table
//! and no deadline of its own. It is a kind because it queues, waits, and
//! dispatches like one — the queue is what orders it after the finalizer.
//!
//! Ending a turn takes two passes. `FinishTurn` queues `turn.finished` with the
//! turn's frozen output, which is what puts this entry in the queue; the turn
//! completes only once that finalizer settles
//! ([`Dep::DecisionSettled`](super::super::schedule::Dep)). A `done` echo from
//! the worker emits `TurnCompleted` itself and removes the entry before the plan
//! reaches it; this entry covers a finalizer that settles any other way.
