`subs.toml` declares one project. Every key is here.

The CLI reads the file from the working directory, or from the path you pass
with `-c`. It does not search parent directories.

An unknown key is a parse error.

## A full file

```toml title="subs.toml"
name = "support-bot"
db = "subs.db"
log = "info"

[llm.claude]
type = "anthropic"

[agent.support]
llm = "claude"
model = "claude-sonnet-4-5"
system = "You are a support agent."
mcp = ["mcp.sentry"]
subagents = ["agent.researcher"]

[agent.researcher]
description = "Finds and reads sources."
llm = "claude"
model = "claude-haiku-4-5"

[mcp.sentry]
url = "https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp"

[agent.support.slack]
name = "Support"

[serve]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 8080

[remote]
url = "https://api.substructure.ai"
org = "org_01hx…"
project = "proj_01hx…"
```

## What a file describes

A file has two roles. It can have one or both.

| Role | Keys | Commands |
| --- | --- | --- |
| An engine you run | `db`, `log`, `[serve]` | `subs run`, `subs serve` |
| A deployment you administer | `[remote]` | `subs apply`, `subs keys`, `subs sessions` |

The project itself stays the same for both roles: `name`, `[llm.<id>]`,
`[agent.<id>]`, `[mcp.<id>]`, and `[plugin.<id>]`.

A second environment is a second file. `subs apply -c subs.staging.toml`
deploys a separate project.

## Top level

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | none | The project's name. `subs apply` creates the project from it and renames it when it changes. |
| `max_subagent_depth` | integer | `5` | How deep subagents may nest, for every agent. An agent's own value wins. See [Subagents](./80-subagents.md#how-deep-subagents-nest). |
| `db` | path | `~/.config/subs/subs.db` | The SQLite file holding events, sessions, and connector credentials. A relative path resolves against the file. |
| `log` | string | `error` for `run`, `info` for `serve` | A `RUST_LOG` filter. `$RUST_LOG` wins over it. |
| `send_timeout_secs` | integer | `30` | How long the engine waits to hand off work or a batch of events. After that it tries again later. |

Unset, `db` is `~/.config/subs/subs.db`, beside `credentials.toml`. Every
command on the machine reads that one, whichever directory it runs in and
whether or not a file is there. Set `db` to give a project its own. Two files
that both set it are two engines.

## `[llm.<id>]`

Where a model call runs. An agent names a block by its ID.

```toml
[llm.claude]
type = "anthropic"
api_key_env = "MY_ANTHROPIC_KEY"

[llm.byo]
type = "worker"
format = "anthropic"
```

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | `anthropic`, `openai`, `openrouter`, `worker` | required | Who makes the call. |
| `api_key_env` | string | the vendor's own variable | The variable holding the key. For an engine you run. |
| `base_url` | url | the vendor's own | Where to send the call. |
| `format` | `openai`, `anthropic` | the engine's own shape | The wire shape of the `llm.execute` a worker answers. `type = "worker"` only. |
| `cache_ttl` | `5m`, `1h` (`anthropic`, `openrouter`); `in_memory`, `24h` (`openai`) | the vendor's own | How long the vendor holds a cached prompt prefix. |

There is no default block and no fallback. An agent names a block, or its calls
fail. See [LLMs](./70-llms.md).

A `worker` block takes no `api_key_env`, `base_url`, or `cache_ttl`. The call
never leaves your worker.

`api_key_env` names a variable on your machine. `subs apply` removes it. A
deployment refuses a document that carries one.

## `[agent.<id>]`

An agent. The ID is what clients, channels, and parent agents route on.

```toml
[agent.support]
llm = "claude"
model = "claude-sonnet-4-5"
system = "You are a support agent."
mcp = ["mcp.sentry"]
subagents = ["agent.researcher"]
tools = [{ name = "confirm", description = "Ask a person", handler = "client" }]
worker = "https://bot.example.com/agent"
signing_secret_env = "SUPPORT_SIGNING_SECRET"

[agent.support.retry]
tool = { max_attempts = 3 }
```

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `llm` | string | required with config | The `[llm.<id>]` block. |
| `model` | string | required with config | The model. |
| `system` | string | none | The system prompt. |
| `effort` | string | the provider's own | How hard the model thinks: `xhigh`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `minimal`, or `none`. |
| `description` | string | none | What this agent does, shown to a parent that calls it. |
| `mcp` | list | none | Connections this agent draws tools from. See [`mcp` and `plugins` entries](#mcp-and-plugins-entries). |
| `plugins` | list | none | Plugins this agent uses. See [`mcp` and `plugins` entries](#mcp-and-plugins-entries). |
| `defer_tools` | bool or table | absent | Keeps every tool of this agent out of the request, whatever its source. See [Defer every tool](#defer-every-tool). |
| `mcp_announce` | `auto`, `never` | `auto` | Whether the engine tells the model that a connection is available. See [Tell the model a connection exists](./40-connectors.md#tell-the-model-a-connection-exists). |
| `mcp_auth_failure` | `interrupt`, `degrade` | `interrupt` | The default for every connection this agent reaches, including each plugin's. A connection overrides it with its own `auth_failure`. |
| `mcp_tool_sync_failure` | `warn`, `silent` | `warn` | The default for every connection this agent reaches, including each plugin's. A connection overrides it with its own `tool_sync_failure`. |
| `subagents` | list | none | Agents this one can call. Each entry is an `agent.<id>` path, or a table with `id`, `defer`, and `prefix`. See [Subagents](./80-subagents.md#how-the-tool-is-offered). |
| `subagent_tools` | table | `{ strategy = "per_agent" }` | What shape the subagents take as tools. `per_agent` offers one tool per agent; `single` offers one `subagent` tool for all of them. See [Subagents](./80-subagents.md#one-tool-for-every-subagent). |
| `max_subagent_depth` | integer | `5` | How deep this agent's subagents may nest. A session that deep may not delegate; `0` never delegates. See [Subagents](./80-subagents.md#how-deep-subagents-nest). |
| `tools` | list | none | Browser tools. Each needs `handler = "client"`. |
| `attachments` | table | none | How files reach the model. See [`[agent.<id>.attachments]`](#agentidattachments). |
| `worker` | url | none | Where decisions go. Leave it off and the engine decides. |
| `events` | string | none | The `[events.<id>]` block that gets this agent's events. See [Events URL](./55-events-url.md). |
| `signing_secret_env` | string | none | The variable holding the signing secret. For an engine you run. |
| `retry` | table | engine defaults | Timeouts and attempts, per kind. See [Retries](./210-retries.md). |

An agent that sets no config needs a `worker`. An agent that sets any config
needs `llm` and `model`. See [Agents](./30-agents.md).

The tools your worker runs are worker code. They do not go in the file.

### `mcp` and `plugins` entries

Each entry is an ID on its own, or a table. `mcp` takes a connection path such
as `mcp.sentry` or `plugin.pdf.mcp.renderer`. `plugins` takes a plugin ID.

```toml
[agent.support]
mcp = [
  "mcp.sentry",
  { id = "mcp.linear", tools = { read_only = true }, approve = "destructive" },
]
```

| Key | Values | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | path or plugin ID | required | Which connection or plugin. |
| `tools` | table | every tool | The filter, and `defer`. See [Filter the tools](./40-connectors.md#filter-the-tools). |
| `approve` | `never`, `destructive`, `always` | `never` | Which calls stop and ask a person. See [Ask a person before a call runs](./40-connectors.md#ask-a-person-before-a-call-runs). |
| `auth_failure` | `interrupt`, `degrade` | `interrupt` | What happens when the credential stops working. See [When a credential stops working](./40-connectors.md#when-a-credential-stops-working). |
| `tool_sync_failure` | `warn`, `silent` | `warn` | Whether the model is told that a connection could not be reached. See [Connection failures](./40-connectors.md#connection-failures). |

On a `plugins` entry these settings apply to each of the plugin's MCP servers.

### Defer every tool

`defer_tools = true` takes the defaults. A table sets them. The presence of the
key is the switch, so an agent cannot carry a setting that does nothing. A tool
or a connection overrides it with its own `defer`.

| Key | Values | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `strategy` | `search` | `search` | Which tools find the deferred ones. `search` is the only value today. |
| `max_matches` | number, at least 1 | `5` | How many matches one search answers with. |

See [Deferred tools](./65-deferred-tools.md).

## `[agent.<id>.attachments]`

How each file the agent receives reaches the model. Without this section every
file rides in the prompt as media, and the agent offers no attachment tool.

```toml
[agent.analyst.attachments]
tools = ["read", "view"]
max_inline = "20mb"

[agent.analyst.attachments.rules]
"image/*"         = "inline"
"application/pdf" = "inline"
"*/*"             = "attachment"
```

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tools` | list | none | The attachment tools this agent offers: `read`, `view`, or both. |
| `max_inline` | size | no limit | A file over this size becomes an `attachment`, whatever its rule says. `"20mb"`, or a number of bytes. |
| `rules` | table | none | Mime pattern to `inline` or `attachment`. |

A key in `rules` is a mime pattern: an exact type (`application/pdf`), a type
wildcard (`image/*`), or `*/*`. The most specific match wins. A file no pattern matches rides as media, the way it does without
this section.

`inline` keeps the file in the prompt and adds one line naming it. `attachment`
keeps the line alone. The line reads
`[attachment sales.csv text/csv 2.1 MB]`. The id is the file name, with a
counter when the name is already taken on this conversation. The bytes are
stored in both cases, and the model reads them with `attachment_read` (text) or
`attachment_view` (image, audio, and video).

The decision is made once, when the file arrives, and never changes.

The same table is `attachments` on the agent config, so a worker can set it
at `session.start` like any other field. The rules are applied when a message
is delivered to the worker, after `session.start` has settled the config, so
they cover the first message of a session too.

## `[events.<id>]`

A URL that gets the events and the live text of the sessions of each agent that
names it. See [Events URL](./55-events-url.md).

```toml
[events.app]
url = "https://app.example.com/events"
```

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | url | required | Where the engine POSTs events and live text. |
| `timeout_secs` | integer | `10` | How long one POST may take before the engine sends it again later. At most `15`. |

## `[mcp.<id>]`

An MCP server the engine connects to.

```toml
[mcp.sentry]
url = "https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp"

[mcp.github]
url = "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
auth = "token"
prefix_tools = false
```

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | url | required | The server. |
| `auth` | string | ask the server | Override how it authenticates: `"token"`, `"oauth"`, or `"none"`. |
| `header` | string | `Authorization` | Header a static token rides in. Only under `auth = "token"`. |
| `credential` | string | `"shared"` | Whose credential the connection dials with: `"shared"` for one, `"user"` for one per person. |
| `scopes` | list | ask the server | The access to ask consent for. The server's own list is its maximum, not its recommendation. |
| `client_id_env` | string | none | Variable holding the OAuth client, for a server that issues none. Named, never written. |
| `client_secret_env` | string | none | The secret half. Only alongside `client_id_env`. |
| `prefix_tools` | bool | `true` | Show the model `<id>__<tool>` instead of the connection's own names. |

A token written in the file is a parse error. Fill a connection with
`subs auth <path>`. See [Connectors](./40-connectors.md).

## `[plugin.<id>]`

A plugin directory the CLI resolves and sends to the deployment. An agent names
a plugin by its ID.

```toml
[plugin.pdf]
path = "./plugins/pdf-tools"

[plugin.pdf.mcp.renderer]
auth = "none"
```

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | path | required | The plugin directory. |
| `mcp.<server>` | table | the plugin's own | What this deployment says about one of the plugin's servers. See [`[plugin.<id>.mcp.<server>]`](#pluginidmcpserver). |

The CLI resolves the directory to data, at startup for a local engine and at
`subs apply` for a deployment, so a session never reads plugin files. A plugin's
servers join the connection registry as `plugin.<id>.mcp.<server>` and authorize
like any connection. The model sees their tools under
`<plugin>_<server>__<tool>`. See [Plugins](./45-plugins.md).

### `[plugin.<id>.mcp.<server>]`

What this deployment says about one server the plugin declares, keyed by its
name in the plugin's `mcp.json`. Every key overrides the plugin's. One left out
keeps what the plugin shipped.

```toml
[plugin.pdf.mcp.renderer]
auth = "token"
url = "https://pdf.staging.example.com/mcp"
```

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | url | the plugin's | Where this deployment reaches the server. |
| `auth` | string | ask the server | `"oauth"`, `"token"`, or `"none"`. `mcp.json` has no field for it. |
| `header` | string | `Authorization` | Header carrying a static token. Only under `auth = "token"`. |
| `credential` | string | `shared` | `shared` or `user`. |
| `scopes` | list | none | The access to ask consent for. |
| `client_id_env` | string | none | Variable holding the OAuth client. Named, never written. |
| `client_secret_env` | string | none | The secret half. |
| `prefix_tools` | bool | `true` | Show the model `<id>__<tool>`. |

Authorize it by its path: `subs auth plugin.pdf.mcp.renderer`.

## `[agent.<id>.slack]`

Gives one agent its own Slack app. The block being there is the whole
declaration.

```toml
[agent.support.slack]
name = "Support"
description = "Answers customer questions"
answers = "both"
```

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | the agent ID | The bot's name in Slack. Up to 35 characters. |
| `description` | string | none | The app's About text. Up to 140 characters. |
| `answers` | `both`, `dm`, `channels` | `both` | Where the bot answers. |

Every agent with this block is a separate Slack app. Which channels it answers
in is decided in Slack, by who invites it.

Run `subs auth agent.<id>.slack` to set it up. See [Slack](./130-slack.md).

## `[serve]`

Defaults for `subs serve`.

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | string | `127.0.0.1` | The address to bind. |
| `port` | number | `8080` | The port. |
| `auth` | bool | `true` | Client and worker authentication. Set `false` only for a server nothing off this machine can reach. |
| `max_body` | size | `8mb` | The largest request body the engine accepts. A file arrives base64, which is 4/3 its size, so this carries a file of about 6 MB. `"8mb"`, or a number of bytes. |
| `public_url` | url | none | The HTTPS address a browser reaches this engine at. Setting it lets the engine mint MCP authorize links and host the callback. See [Self-hosting](./180-self-hosting.md#let-people-authorize-mcp-connections-from-a-link). |

`max_body` covers what reaches the engine: a client message and a worker's
decision answer. It does not cover what the engine sends a worker. A
worker that hosts the model receives the media in the prompt, so its own
server must accept a body that size.

## `[remote]`

The deployment this file administers. That can be the hosted cloud, one you
host, or another person's `subs serve`.

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | url | `https://api.substructure.ai` | The API to talk to. |
| `org` | ID | none | Written by `subs link` or `subs apply`. |
| `project` | ID | none | Written by `subs apply` when it creates the project. |

`subs apply` writes the pin back into the file and keeps your comments. A second
apply changes nothing.

## Precedence

**flag > environment variable > `subs.toml` > default**

Setting a value in the file still lets you override it on the command line.

The message, `--input`, and `--session` have no key in the file. They say what
one run does.

## Secrets

The file names secrets. It never holds them.

| Secret | How the file refers to it |
| --- | --- |
| Provider key | `api_key_env` on the LLM block, for an engine you run. `subs auth` for a deployment. |
| Signing secret | `signing_secret_env` on the agent, for an engine you run. The deployment creates its own. |
| Events signing secret | `subs secret events.<id>`, for an engine you run. |
| Connector token | `subs auth <path>`. |
| Slack tokens | `$SLACK_APP_TOKEN_<AGENT>` and `$SLACK_BOT_TOKEN_<AGENT>`, or `subs auth agent.<id>.slack`. |

`subs apply` strips `api_key_env` and `signing_secret_env` before it sends.

## Next steps

- [Agents](./30-agents.md): what an agent section declares.
- [Plugins](./45-plugins.md): what a `[plugin.<id>]` directory holds.
- [CLI](./260-cli.md): the commands that read this file.
- [Cloud](./170-cloud.md): applying it to a deployment.
- [Protocol](./230-protocol.md): the same types on the wire.
