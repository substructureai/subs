Agent state is any JSON. The engine stores it and never reads it.

It travels with every decision. The engine sends it on the request as `state`,
and your worker can write a new value on the response. A worker that holds no
state of its own gets a memory for each session.

## Example

```javascript title="server.mjs"
function decide({ trigger, proposed, state }) {
    if (trigger.type === "session.start") {
        return { agent: { model: "claude-haiku-4-5" }, state: { turns: 0 } };
    }

    if (trigger.type === "client.messages") {
        return { ...proposed, state: { turns: (state?.turns ?? 0) + 1 } };
    }

    return proposed;   // no state key keeps the current state
}
```

## Read and write state

The engine sends the current state on every request. To change it, return a new
`state` on the decision.

| Response `state` | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| a value | Replaces the state. |
| `{}` | Clears the state. |
| omitted or `null` | Keeps the current state. |

Writing the same value again records no new version. A session with no state
reads as `null`, so check for it.

## Start a session with state

Your backend can put the first state on the session. Send `state` on the machine
API's [`submit`](./250-api.md#post-apimachinesessionssubmit). The engine writes
it before the first decision, so `session.start` reads it.

```sh
curl $BASE/api/machine/sessions/submit \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "agent_id": "my-agent",
      "identity": { "id": "user_42" },
      "state": { "plan": "pro", "turns": 0 },
      "payload": { "type": "client.message", "message": { "role": "user", "content": "hi" } }
    }'
```

```javascript title="server.mjs"
function decide({ trigger, state }) {
    if (trigger.type === "session.start") {
        return { agent: { model: state.plan === "pro" ? "claude-opus-5" : "claude-haiku-4-5" } };
    }
}
```

The engine reads `state` only on the submit that creates the session. A later
submit ignores it. The worker owns the state after the start.

The client API does not take `state`. A browser must not write agent state.

## State on a branch

The engine attaches state to the message tree. If you edit an earlier message or
branch the conversation, the engine reads the state as it was at that point.

`DecisionRequest.state` is always correct for the active path. See
[Conversations](./120-conversations.md).

## How state differs from config

Both travel with the decision, and the engine versions them the same way. It
reads them differently.

The agent config is a typed document that the engine reads to propose model
calls. State is memory that the engine stores and returns unchanged.

## Reference

```typescript
// DecisionRequest
state: unknown          // your state, stored exactly as it is

// DecisionResponse
state?: unknown         // omitted or null keeps it. {} clears it
```

## Next steps

- [Workers](./50-workers.md): where you read and write it.
- [Conversations](./120-conversations.md): the tree state attaches to.
- [Durability](./200-durability.md): the engine saves state and restores it.
