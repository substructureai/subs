An interrupt is a saved pause. A worker stops the session to wait for a person.

A paused session uses no compute and survives a restart. A later resume gives
the worker that person's answer.

## Example

The worker pauses before a sensitive action, then acts on the answer.

```javascript title="server.mjs"
function decide({ trigger, proposed }) {
    if (trigger.type === "tool.execute" && trigger.name === "send_email") {
        return { actions: [{ type: "interrupt", reason: "confirm", payload: { message: "Send the email?" } }] };
    }

    if (trigger.type === "interrupt.resumed") {
        return trigger.payload?.approved
            ? { actions: [{ type: "tool.result", result: { content: [{ type: "text", text: "sent" }] } }] }
            : { actions: [{ type: "tool.error", error: "declined" }] };
    }

    return proposed;
}
```

The engine raises an interrupt itself when a connection says to. See
[Ask a person before a call runs](./40-connectors.md#ask-a-person-before-a-call-runs).

A person resumes it by ID.

```jsonc
{ "type": "interrupt.resume", "interrupt_id": "int-1", "payload": { "approved": true } }
```

In Slack, an interrupt with a `message` in its payload posts buttons. See
[Slack](./130-slack.md#interrupt-prompts).

## Pause a branch

Return an `interrupt` action. `reason` is required. `payload` carries whatever
the person needs to see. If you omit `interrupt_id`, the engine creates one.

An interrupt attaches to the conversation head where the worker raised it. It
pauses that branch. Several interrupts can be open at once, on the same branch
or on different ones.

An interrupt raised before any message exists pauses every branch. System
pauses, such as a budget stop, work this way.

The engine cancels the model calls in flight on the paused branch. Calls on
other branches keep running, and so do tools and subagents that already
started.

## Resume a branch

An `interrupt.resume` input clears the interrupt by ID.

If that interrupt paused the active branch, the worker receives an
`interrupt.resumed` trigger with the resume payload. Clearing an interrupt on a
branch nobody uses sends nothing. An old or repeated ID does nothing.

## What happens while paused

The engine refuses new messages on the paused branch. It still records work that
ends an open call, and holds the next decision until the resume.

A paused turn is still the same turn. A pause emits no `turn.completed`, and a
resume starts no new turn. Events before and after the pause carry the same
`turn_id`.

A frontend can still end its own unit of work. [AG-UI](./140-ag-ui.md) ends the
run at an interrupt, because a run is one HTTP request. The resume opens a new
run inside the same engine turn.

The rest of the tree stays live. A client view that edits an earlier message
branches below the interrupt's anchor and runs as normal. The interrupt stays
open on the branch that the client left.

## Answer a prompt

A payload with `metadata.options` renders as a choice, such as Slack buttons. A
channel answers on the person's behalf, and the resume that it sends says which
option the person picked.

```json
{ "status": "resolved",
  "payload": { "decision": "approve" },
  "responder": { "channel": "slack", "user": "U…", "label": "Approve", "style": "primary" } }
```

The inner `payload` is the chosen option's `value`, read from the recorded
interrupt, so a click cannot send a value that the interrupt did not offer. The
channel stamps the `responder`, and the requester never does. It names who
answered, and carries the option's `label` and `style`, which the engine drops
once the interrupt resolves.

The worker then gets an `interrupt.resumed` trigger with this payload. A worker
that wants its own rules, such as who may answer, reads the `responder` there
and can raise the interrupt again. A second click on a prompt that is already
answered does nothing.

## Reference

```typescript
// action
{ type: "interrupt", interrupt_id?: string, reason: string, payload?: unknown }

// action, to clear one yourself
{ type: "interrupt.resolve", interrupt_id: string, payload?: unknown }

// trigger
{ type: "interrupt.resumed", interrupt_id: string, payload?: unknown }

// client input
{ type: "interrupt.resume", interrupt_id: string, payload?: unknown }
```
