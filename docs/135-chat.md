`subs chat` is an agent session in your terminal. It is a channel, like
[Slack](./130-slack.md): a line you type becomes a client message, and the event
stream becomes text.

```sh
subs chat assistant
```

```text
assistant
  model   claude-sonnet-5
  llm     claude (anthropic)
  session 01a02417-7d46-7441-8090-23b20d0f980f

> what is the capital of Portugal?
The capital of Portugal is Lisbon.

> how far is it from Madrid?
About 500 km.

>
```

`subs run` sends one message and exits, so a second message needs `--session`
and a second process. Chat holds the session, so the next question can depend on
the last one.

## Where the turn runs

The file decides, as it does for every other command. A file that names no
`[remote]` describes an engine here, so chat starts one in the process and the
session lands in this machine's database. A file that names one describes a
deployment, so chat streams the turn from there.

```sh
subs chat assistant                                # the file decides
subs chat assistant --url http://localhost:8080    # a deployment, for this chat
```

`--url` also points at a `subs serve` you are running, which is how to chat with
the engine that answers your Slack workspace.

See [CLI](./260-cli.md#where-a-command-acts).

## The session

A chat with no `--session` opens a new one and prints its ID. `Ctrl-D` ends the
chat and prints the command to pick it back up.

```text
continue this session with:
  subs chat assistant --session 01a02417-7d46-7441-8090-23b20d0f980f
```

The session is durable and outlives the process. `subs sessions list` shows it,
`subs run --session` adds a turn to it, and a Slack thread on the same engine is
the same kind of thing. See [Conversations](./120-conversations.md).

## Editing and history

`↑` walks the lines you have typed, in this chat and in earlier ones. The
history file is beside your credentials, at `~/.config/subs/chat_history`.

A line ending in `\` is not finished, so `Enter` opens the next one and the
message carries the newline. `Alt-Enter` and `Ctrl-J` do the same.

```text
> summarise this: \
  the first point \
  the second point
```

## Progress while a turn runs

A turn is quiet between the model call and its first token, and again while a
tool runs. A line below the transcript names the step in progress and counts the
time it takes.

```text
⠙ fetch_url (7s)
```

It names one call, counts a batch of them (`2 tools`), and counts the attempts
when the engine tries the same call again. The line is drawn on stderr and
erased before anything else is written, so `subs run` piped into another program
still writes only the turn.

A call is written to the transcript once, when it is answered.

```text
● get_current_time (180ms)
  2026-08-22T09:50:33.010Z
↻ fetch_url {"url":"https://example.com"} (attempt 1, 2.1s)
  503 Service Unavailable
● fetch_url {"url":"https://example.com"} (attempt 2, 1.4s)
  {"status":"ok"}
```

A call on a connection is named by the server and the tool, as each of them
names itself.

```text
● deepwiki Ask a question  {"q":"login page"} (1.2s)
```

A call that took less than a moment shows no time. A result that is only text
reads as that text. A result longer than the screen is cut short, and the rest
is counted.

```text
  … +182 lines
```

## Markdown rendering

Chat renders the answer as CommonMark. Headings, `code`, **bold**, lists,
quotes, and links carry their styling rather than their markers.

An agent whose system prompt asks for Slack mrkdwn reads differently here than
it does in Slack, because Slack's `*bold*` is CommonMark's *italic*.

## Interrupt prompts

A turn that stops to ask something renders the question where you are, and your
answer resumes it. You do not type an interrupt ID.

An interrupt whose `metadata.options` names answers renders them as a picker,
the same list Slack draws as buttons. `↑` and `↓` pick, `Enter` answers, and the
turn carries on in the same chat.

````text
? Run `issues__delete_issue`?

```
{
  "id": "7"
}
```  ›
❯ Run it
  Decline
````

An interrupt that offers no options takes typed text, delivered whole as the
resolution payload.

A question waits in the session, not in the process. `Ctrl-C` at a question ends
the chat and leaves the question open, and a chat that opens that session with
`--session` asks the question first, before reading a line.

What chat resolves is stamped `channel: "cli"`, so the session records which
channel answered and which option was picked, the same way Slack's does. See
[Interrupts](./100-interrupts.md).

## Cancel a turn

`Ctrl-C` during a turn cancels it and its subagents. The chat goes back to the
prompt, and the session stays usable. A second `Ctrl-C` stops watching and ends
the chat. See [Cancel a run](./100-interrupts.md#cancel-a-run).

## Limitations

Chat has no slash commands, and it cannot send a message while a turn is
running.

Chat cannot settle a client-side tool call, so it says so and stops.

```text
⧗ get_weather is waiting on a client-side result, which this chat cannot settle.
```

Use `subs run <agent> --input '{"type":"tool.result",…}'` for those. See
[Client tools](./150-client-tools.md).
